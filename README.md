# image-binder
This easy script merges multiple images into one. 
Usage:
python bind.py box_size(x)xbox_size(y) inputfile1, inputfile2, ...

Where box_size(x) is a number of columns and box_size(y) is a number of rows. So if you want merge 4 files into 2 rows and 2 columns just use 2x2 as parameter (without spaces).
